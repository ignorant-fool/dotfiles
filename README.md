# dotfiles
This repo contains my dotfiles for Alacritty, Fish, and Neofetch for my unix systems.
I currently run these on 

- MacOS Ventura on MacBook Pro M1
- (eventually Arch when I rebuild my linux set up)

Inspiration generally taken from 
- DevAsLife / Craftzdog [here](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public). ありがと　ございます　松山　拓也さん。
- Specifically NerdFont set-up on Arch from chris@machine [here](https://youtu.be/fR4ThXzhQYI).
- Tawnniee [here](https://www.twitch.tv/tawnniee) and [here](https://github.com/twny) (specifically the prompt colouring).
