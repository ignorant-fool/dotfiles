# dotfiles
This repo contains my dotfiles for Alacritty, Fish, and Neofetch for my unix systems.
I currently run these on 

- Arch linux on Desktop PC.
- MacOS Monterey on MacBook Pro M1
- (hopefully) Asahi Linux on MacBook Pro M1.

I do not do any programming on my Windows machine lmao, and I _can't_ use these on my work Windows machine even if I wanted too 🙃.

Dotfiles for Fish generally come from DevAsLife / Craftzdog [here](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public). ありがと　ございます　松山　拓也さん。
